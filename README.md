# Get New Netflix Movies by a Recommendation System

This recommendation system was iniciated and learned during my Data Science training, beside the data exploration below, I’m also going to build a new application to show this recommentation to the end user in the near future.

## Requirements

The requirements to run this Jupyter Notebook is downloading all datasets needed from Kaggle Netflix competition.

The Netflix dataset is from Kaggle competition “Netflix Prize data”, so they can improve their reccommendation algorithm, despite being an old competition we still can learn a lot from it. You can get the dataset as well from here.
For this exploration, we are going to use just the .txt files (combined_data..) and the movie_titles.csv file.
